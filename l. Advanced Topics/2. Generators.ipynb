    "## Generators\n",
    "(Temporary Iterable)\n",
    "A generator in Python is a type of iterable, like lists or tuples. However, unlike lists, generators do not store their contents in memory. Instead, they generate values on the fly, which makes them much more memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does a Generator Work?\n",
    "Defining a Generator: You define a generator function just like a normal function, but instead of using return to return a value, you use yield. This yield statement pauses the function and saves its state, so it can be resumed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a Generator: When you call a generator function, it doesn't execute the function immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object. You can then iterate over this object to get the values one at a time."

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Iterators and generators are powerful tools in Python for creating and handling sequences of data efficiently. Iterators provide a way to access elements sequentially, while generators allow you to generate items on the fly, making them particularly useful for handling large datasets and infinite sequences. Understanding these concepts will enable you to write more efficient and memory-conscious Python programs."
